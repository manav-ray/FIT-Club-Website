                <p> Our goal is to build a community of students who are committed to improving their physical and mental health. We believe that in addition to developing the body, fitness consists of strengthening and developing the mind, and eating a diet
                    which benefits both the body and the mind. We provide the resources and support necessary for you to pursue a healthier lifestyle in a non-judgemental environment, and we hope that you will join us in striving towards living a better,
                    and a fitter life.

                <p> We envision bringing together a group of students who collaborate, encourage, and help one another in the pursuit of their personal fitness goals. We appreciate those in the Blacksburg community and intend to give back through fundraising,
                    participating in local philanthropies, and aspiring to be positive influences in the lives of others.
